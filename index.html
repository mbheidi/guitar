 <h3> 1. The perfect size is the one you feel the most comfortable with</h3>
 <p> When you get to the store try playing different guitars, and choose the one you feel most comftable </p>

 <h3> 2. The neck should not be too thick </h3>
 <p> If the neck is too tick, it's going to be harder to place your hands in the correct place when playing. If it's smaller, then you have more space, and you won't have to stretch you hand as much </p>
 
 <h3> 3. Buy a guitar where you can reach all the frets </h3>
  <p> it really depends on what type of guitar you are interested in playing, but for example: with classical guitar you won't be able to reach all the chords as easily as you would in an acoustic guitar </p>
  
  
  <h3> Tips: 
   
   1. If you are a beginner don't tune your guitar by ear </h3>
    <p> It is very likely that you will end up breaking a string. I recommed downloading the app GuitarTuna </p>
 
  <h3> 2.Challenge yourself and learn that chord you've been trying to avoid 
   <p> It will really make a difference, and if you want to improve, you have to try to learn those hard notes. We all go through that stage. </p>
   
   <h3> 3. Practice is key </h3>
 <p> If you want to make progress, then you have to give it some time. Practice is essential</p>
