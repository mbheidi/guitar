 <h3> 1. The perfect size is the one you feel the most comfortable with</h3>
   <p> When you get to the store try playing different guitars, and choose the one you feel most comfortable </p>
 <h3> 2. The neck should not be too thick </h3>
   <p> If the neck is too tick, it's going to be harder to place your hands in the correct place when playing. If it's smaller, then you have more space, and you won't have to stretch you hand as much </p>
 <h3> 3. Buy a guitar where you can reach all the frets </h3>
  <p> It really depends on what type of guitar you are interested in playing, but for example: with classical guitar you won't be able to reach all the chords as easily as you would in an acoustic guitar </p>

  <h3 style="color : blue;"> Tips: </h3>
   <h3>1. If you are a beginner don't tune your guitar by ear </h3>
    <p> It is very likely that you will end up breaking a string. I recommed downloading the app GuitarTuna. </p>
 <h3> 2.Challenge yourself and learn that chord you've been trying to avoid </h3>
   <p>It will really make a difference, and if you want to improve, you have to try to learn those hard notes. We all go through that stage.</p>
 <h3>3. Practice is key</h3>
  <p> If you want to make progress, then you have to give it some time. Practice is essential.</p>
  
  <h3 style="color : blue;"> Gear you should consider: </h3>
  <h3>1. Capo </h3>
  <p> While you learn how to play barr chords, a capo will be very useful</p>

 <h3>2.A tuner (if your guitar doesn't have one) </h3> 
   <p> You can buy a physical one, but if you don't want to buy one I strongly recommend downloading the app GuitarTuna. </p>

 <h3> 3. Get some picks </h3>
   <p>Instead of using your finger you can use a pick, and the sound quality will sound much better. You can get these at Amazon for a really good price </p>
